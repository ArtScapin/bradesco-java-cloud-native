## Sudoku - Challenge

Let's practice all the content presented in the Java programming module by implementing a Sudoku game in the terminal.

The objective of this challenge is to create a fully functional Sudoku game that can be played via the terminal. The game should allow users to:

1. Start a new Sudoku game with a pre-defined or randomly generated puzzle.
2. Input numbers to solve the puzzle, following Sudoku rules.
3. Display the current state of the Sudoku board at all times.
4. Check if the solution is correct and display a success message when the puzzle is completed.
5. Provide an option to reset or quit the game.

### Requirements:

1. Create the `SudokuGame` project.
2. Inside the project, create the game logic, including board representation, validation, and input handling.
3. Implement methods for:
    - Generating a Sudoku board.
    - Validating user inputs (ensuring numbers follow Sudoku rules).
    - Displaying the board in a readable format in the terminal.
    - Checking if the puzzle is completed correctly.
4. Provide a simple menu system for user interaction.

This project will enhance your Java skills by implementing object-oriented programming, user input handling, and logical validation. Good luck coding your Sudoku game!
