# Creating a Digital Bank with Java and Object Orientation

Challenge: Considering our knowledge of the banking domain, we will abstract an Object Oriented solution in Java. To do this, let's interpret the following scenario:
“A bank offers its customers two types of accounts (current and savings), which have the functionalities of deposit, withdrawal and transfer (between accounts of the institution itself).”

### Abstraction
The ability to concentrate on the essential aspects of a domain, ignoring less important or accidental characteristics. In this context, objects are abstractions of existing entities in the domain in question.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation means hiding the implementation of objects, thus creating more concise and easier to use/understand user interfaces. Encapsulation mainly favors two aspects of a system: maintenance and evolution.

### Inheritance
Allows you to define a child class that reuses (inherits), extends or modifies the behavior of a parent class. The class whose members are inherited is called the base class. The class that inherits the members of the base class is called the derived class.

### Polymorphism
The ability of an object to be referenced in different ways, in other words, the ability to treat objects created from specific classes as objects of a generic class. Be careful, polymorphism doesn't mean that the object keeps changing, quite the opposite, an object is born of a type and dies of that type, what can change is the way we refer to it.
